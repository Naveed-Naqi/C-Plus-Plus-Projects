My attempt at creating a decimal to binary calculator. My timeline for versons is as follows: 

Version 1: Converts a positive decimal number without a fractional part into a binary string and produces the ones complement of that binary string

Version 1.2: Does the same thing as version 1, but with a recursive algorithm. Maybe this will also produce the twos complement. 

Version 1.3: I will experiment with potentially using a linked list to return a binary number. Unsure about this one as of right now. 

Version 2: Will take a decimal number and convert it to any base from 2-36. 

Version 3: Will take a number in any base from 2-36 and convert it to a number in any base from 2-36.

Version 4: Will do the same thing as Version 3, but also return any complement.
